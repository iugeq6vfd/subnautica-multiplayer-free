Installing ZeroTier:

Install ZeroTier, a software that will simulate a local network with your friends.

Your friends will also need to install ZeroTier.

Configuring the ZeroTier network:

Launch ZeroTier and go to the website my.zerotier.com.

Create a network and note the network ID (something like 0c87g752f77e0623).

Share the network ID with your friends so they can connect to the same network as you.
